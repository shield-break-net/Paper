Subject: [PATCH] Cache DataFixerUpper Rewrite Rules on demand

Mojang precaches every single potential rewrite rule that could ever
exist on server startup. This includes rules from all the way back to versions from 6+ years ago.

This is the source of why the server hogs every CPU core at 100% every start.

For anyone who hard resets for updates or has force upgraded their entire world, this
results in completely wasted cpu cycles.

This massive CPU usage also delays server startup time.

We improve this by making "min version to precache" that defaults to a future version
so that no rewrite rules are precached.

someone who expects to be converting a lot chunks could theoretically set
-DPaper.minPrecachedDatafixVersion=<dataVersionConvertingFrom> as a startup
parameter and only build from that point on.

However this will likely never be needed as the server will still run
the same cache logic on demand when it's actually needed. The only
cost would be some delay on the FIRST chunk conversion, but paper already
runs chunk conversions on another thread so this will likely never be
a concern for TPS.

This patch will significantly reduce CPU use on startup, reduce memory usage,
and improve server startup time.
